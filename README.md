Collaborative project on self-driving car simulation

Self-driving Algorithm Development
---
[Description](car/headway.md) of phases of stopping a vehicle and necessary initial headways to avoid collision.



Code so far
-----------

+ car/sim - basic traffic simulator with simple self-driving car who follows you
+ car.py - A simple class for a vehicle object.  Currently just worries about stopping distance and time.  Includes plot.
+ SFML_examples - a basic SFML app in different languages
	main.cpp
	main.py
