bugs
---
* AI gets confused when lead car wraps around, so it tries to max out speed then
    * solution: change to super long (infinite?) track, and just move the view
    * maybe have some trees in the background so you know that you're going?
* AUTOMATIC2 not working right
    * crashing with too high a velocity (low velocity acceptable?)
    * get_stop_d probably bad?
        * improved, but still problems
    * I think this is ok now
* I had back cars collide still (but correctly interpreted)...not sure why
