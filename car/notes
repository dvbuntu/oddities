bugs

* AI gets confused when lead car wraps around, so it tries to max out speed then
    * solution: change to super long (infinite?) track, and just move the view
    * maybe have some trees in the background so you know that you're going?
* AUTOMATIC2 not working right
    * crashing with too high a velocity (low velocity acceptable?)
    * get_stop_d probably bad?
        * improved, but still problems
    * I think this is ok now
    * always reporting the stop_d as 0....hmmm, do I have a min where I should have a max?
        * no, taking the max...but maybe extra minus sign?
        * ok, broadly applying didn't work...
            * how are stopping_dists ever less than zero?
            * ok, missed one minus
            * but positive stopping dist is causing crashes...
                * maybe a minus is all off, just in the direction I'm substracting...yea
                * well, muck with signs too
            * so still getting regular crashes...
                * is the target velocity a mistake?
                * that's not really the problem..
        * could be that stopping_d is off, really ought to be more than a meter...
            * some unit conversion is bad?
                * it's all meters, m/s, and m/s**2  and kg I guess
* I had back cars collide still (but correctly interpreted)...not sure why

issues
---
* AUTOMATIC2 seems a little conservative (but it did crash once)
    * I guess not accounting for drag could be part of that...
    * derp, computing very small acceptable distances...
    * seems ok when turning back into normal...
    * full stop stopping dist has strange affects on things
        * when actual headway is less than this, it gets a little odd
